NSpecifications
====

NSpecifications is an easy-to-use library that provides a good implementation of the specification pattern grounded on  Domain-Driven Design.
Specification pattern can be consitently applyed in order to accomplish 3 different goals:
- Validate an entity by checking if it matches a set of rules
- Filter a collection of objects in-memomry or persisted in a database
- Create objects that fulfill certain criteria. 

The Specification pattern is one of the most flexible and usefull patterns that have been neglected for a lont time, in my opinion due to some challenges that araise when trying to implement it. I'll provide examples for these 3 scenarios and how this library handles them.
